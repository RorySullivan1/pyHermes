  Financial time-series hygiene in pandas/numpy — returns vs prices,
  resampling/alignment, market calendars and missing data, stationarity,
  autocorrelation, volatility estimation (EWMA/GARCH), rolling windows, and
  building features without look-ahead. Use whenever the work touches a price or
  return series, a DatetimeIndex, resampling, rolling/expanding windows,
  volatility estimation, or lagged/rolling feature construction. Trigger on
  phrases like "compute returns", "resample to monthly", "rolling window",
  "estimate volatility", "EWMA", "stationarity", "lag this feature", "align
  these series", or "reindex to trading days". Defer pricing/risk math to
  quantitative-finance, backtest evaluation to backtesting-validation, and
  generic Python to python-development.

# Financial Time-Series Analysis

Correct handling of price and return series in pandas. The recurring danger is
**look-ahead bias** — letting information from time `t` leak into a value
timestamped `t` or earlier — and the recurring chore is getting alignment,
calendars, and resampling right so the series mean what you think they mean.

## Core principles

- **Compute returns the right way.** Simple `p.pct_change()` aggregates across
  assets; log `np.log(p).diff()` aggregates across time. The first observation is
  `NaN` — handle it explicitly, don't `fillna(0)` it into a fake flat day.
- **Every transform has a timestamp contract.** A value at index `t` may only use
  data available at or before `t`. Rolling stats, normalizations, and labels all
  break this by default unless you lag or shift deliberately.
- **Align, don't assume.** Two series rarely share an index. Join on the
  DatetimeIndex (`pd.concat(axis=1)` / `.align()`) and decide how to treat the
  gaps; never zip raw arrays of differing calendars positionally.
- **Calendars are not regular.** Markets skip weekends and holidays. A `freq="D"`
  reindex invents non-trading days; resampling needs the right closed/label side.
- **Missing data is a decision, not a default.** Forward-fill, drop, or
  interpolate are different assumptions with different biases — choose per series,
  and never forward-fill a *return* (fill the price, then recompute).

## Look-ahead: the failure mode to hunt

- **Centered windows leak the future.** `rolling(w, center=True)` labels a window at its
  midpoint, so the value at *t* aggregates observations dated after *t*. Use trailing windows
  for anything that feeds a decision.
- **`ewm` does NOT leak — don't hunt it for that.** pandas' exponentially-weighted window has
  no `center` parameter at all and its weights run strictly backward from *t*, so it cannot
  see the future (verified 2026-08-15: perturbing the last observation leaves every earlier
  `ewm(...).mean()` bit-identical). Its real hazards are different and worth checking instead:
  forgetting to `shift(1)` the resulting feature before acting on it, and fitting its
  span/halflife on the full sample.
- **Normalize with trailing stats only.** A z-score using the full-sample mean/std
  leaks the future into every point. Use `expanding()` or trailing `rolling()`.
- **Shift features, not just intuition.** A signal computed from data through `t`
  can only act on the next bar: `signal.shift(1)` before aligning to forward
  returns. Off-by-one here silently inflates every result.
- **Resample on the close.** When downsampling, label and close on the period end
  (`resample("ME", label="right", closed="right")`) so a monthly bar doesn't
  include data stamped after its own label.

## Common operations (do them this way)

- **Returns:** `simple = px.pct_change()`, `logret = np.log(px).diff()`. Drop or
  mark the leading `NaN`.
- **Resample:** `px.resample("W-FRI").last()` for prices; sum log returns or
  compound simple returns (`(1+r).prod()-1`) when aggregating returns — never
  `.mean()` a return over a coarser period.
- **Align to a trading calendar:** reindex to an explicit trading-day index (e.g.
  from `pandas_market_calendars` if available), not `freq="B"`, which still
  includes holidays.
- **Rolling stats:** `ret.rolling(252).std() * np.sqrt(252)` for trailing annual
  vol; `min_periods` set so early values aren't computed on a partial window.
- **EWMA volatility:** `ret.ewm(span=n).std()` is *EWMA-style but not RiskMetrics*.
  pandas demeans by the exponentially-weighted mean and defaults to `bias=False`; RiskMetrics
  takes the raw second moment about zero with `adjust=False` recursion at λ=0.94. The two are
  close enough to be mistaken for each other and far enough apart to matter for a published
  risk number (measured ~0.01042 vs ~0.01050 on the same series), so either say "EWMA" or
  pass `bias=True, adjust=False` and set λ explicitly. For clustering beyond EWMA reach for a
  GARCH model via the `arch` package (justify + pin). *(Checked 2026-08-15.)*

## Stationarity & dependence

- **Prices aren't stationary; returns usually are.** Model returns (or log
  prices' differences), not raw price levels, for most statistical work.
- **Test, don't assume.** ADF (`statsmodels.tsa.stattools.adfuller`) for a unit
  root; inspect ACF/PACF for autocorrelation before fitting AR/MA orders.
- **Heteroskedasticity is the norm.** Volatility clusters; use EWMA/GARCH or
  robust (HAC/Newey–West) standard errors rather than assuming constant variance.

## Checklist

- [ ] Returns computed with the right type (simple vs log) for the use, leading
      `NaN` handled honestly.
- [ ] No centered windows or full-sample stats feeding a decision; features
      `shift`ed so each value uses only past data.
- [ ] Series aligned on the DatetimeIndex; gaps handled by an explicit, justified
      rule (and returns never forward-filled).
- [ ] Resampling uses correct `closed`/`label` and the right aggregation
      (compound returns, last price).
- [ ] Reindexing respects the trading calendar — no invented non-trading days.
- [ ] `min_periods` set on rolling/expanding stats; partial-window values not
      trusted.

## Anti-patterns

- `rolling(w, center=True)` or full-sample z-scores in anything predictive.
- Forward-filling returns (fill the *price*, then recompute returns).
- `fillna(0)` on a leading return to dodge the `NaN`.
- Averaging returns when resampling instead of compounding/summing.
- `freq="D"`/`"B"` reindex that ignores market holidays.
- Aligning two series by position (`.values`) instead of by index.
- Modeling raw price levels with tools that assume stationarity.

## Out of scope

- **Pricing, discounting, risk metrics, numerical-stability math** →
  `quantitative-finance`.
- **Turning a signal into a backtest, costs, and performance/overfitting
  evaluation** → `backtesting-validation`.
- **Reviewing existing series code for defects** → `quant-code-review`.
- **General pandas/Python idioms unrelated to time-series correctness** →
  `python-development`.
